|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| ISS-001 | Memory usage spikes during high throughput with multiple outputs | Medium | Increase JVM heap size or apply backpressure |
| ISS-002 | `@ERROR` label processing can be delayed during high system load | Low | Adjust error handling configuration for priority |
| ISS-003 | Better Stack token exposure in startup logs | Medium | Add masking for environment variables in startup logs |

### 7.2 Improvement Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add worker thread pool configuration to better utilize multi-core systems
   - Implement output grouping for more efficient buffer flushing

2. **Reliability Enhancements**:
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable failing outputs
   - Implement health check mechanism for dependent services

3. **Configuration Simplification**:
   - Create helper Rake tasks for common configuration patterns
   - Add validation for configuration parameters

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add more comprehensive examples for various fan-out scenarios
   - Include performance tuning guide based on test results

## 8. Conclusion

The Fluentd fan-out functionality meets the requirements specified in the project spec. The plugin successfully demonstrates the ability to:

1. Deliver events to multiple backends (OpenSearch, S3, Better Stack)
2. Support both `@type copy` and `relabel`→`<label>` pipeline patterns
3. Maintain high throughput (>50k events/s) with proper buffer configuration
4. Handle errors gracefully with retry and fallback mechanisms
5. Ensure secure connections and proper credential handling

The plugin is ready for production use with attention to the identified issues and recommendations.
