echo "To properly view SNMPv3 traps in Wireshark:"

echo "1. Open Wireshark and go to Edit â†’ Preferences"

echo "3. Scroll down and select 'SNMP'"
echo "4. Make sure the following settings are configured:"
echo "   - Check 'Validate packet' is UNCHECKED (can cause decoding issues)"
echo "   - For SNMPv3 decryption, click 'User Table' and add:"
echo "     Username: NCEadmin"
echo "     Authentication: SHA1"
echo "     Password: P@ssw0rdauth"
echo "     Privacy: AES"
echo "     Password: P@ssw0rddata"

echo "   - Go to 'Name Resolution' section"
echo "   - Select 'SNMP' subsection"
echo "   - Check 'Load MIB modules'"
echo "   - Add your MIB path: $(pwd)/fluentd-snmp/mibs"

echo -e "\n6. After adjusting these settings, restart Wireshark"
